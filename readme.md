## **Day_1 : Introduction to iverilog design test bench** 
### Lecture + VSD-IAT recordining Topics 
* RTL

RTL refers to Register Transfer Level, a design abstraction that models a circuit in terms of the flow between signals and the logical operations performed
* Verilog HDL

Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) is a language used to describe the behaviour of a circuit.
* RTL Deisgn

The behavioural representation of the required specification, written in verilog HDL

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day_1/lab/11.jpg)

RTL design is checked and verified using simulator for adherence to spec by simulatind the design
* iverilog

iverilog is the tool used for simulating the design, to verify the intent of design
the simulator acts by identifying changes in the input signal and evaluating the output based on changes identified from the input
output file dumped out is known as the vcd (value change format) file, to be viewed in gtkwave tool

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day_1/lab/12.jpg)
* gktkwave

gtkwave is a waveform analyzer tool primarily used for visualization
* Design

Design is the verilog code/codes which has the intended functionality meeting the required specification
* Testbench

testbench applies test vectors to the design to check its functionality
checks wether design is obeying to the required specifications
* Verilog files

design verilog file will need to have an associated testbench_design verilog file to be loaded into iverilog
design and testbench file will have a one to one coorespondance
* Library files

the library file is a collection of modules containinga a variety of standard cells
* Logic synthesis

Synthesizer is the tool used to convert RTL into a netlist
The synthesizer maps the RTL code with the digital logic circuit,using a given library file, to generate a netlist
* Netlist

Design is converted into gates and the connections are made between the gates, this file is given out as the netlist
The netlist can then be verified with the cooresponding testbench through the simulator

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day_1/lab/15.jpg)
* Clock timing and frequency claculation

The library file used in generating a netlist has a different sets of standards cells with variying speeds due to the combinational delay in circuit
Combinational delay in the logic path determines the maximum speed of operatiom of the logic circuit

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day_1/lab/16.jpg)

Because the circuit is affected by setup and hold timings, we need to have a variety usage of cells
* Setup and Hold 

Setup time refers to the time needed for data at input, to become stable before the active edge of clock
Hold time refers to the time needed for data at input, to become stable after the active edge of clock

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day_1/lab/17.jpg)
* Selection of cells

We need cells to work fast to meet the required performance, but will sacrifice power and area
But, to handle hold issues that may be present, we need to have cells that work slow, which will also cause circuit to be sluggish
Guidance is needed for the synthesizer to select the appropriate cells for optimum implementation of the logic circuit, this guidance is offered though the use of constraints

## **Day_2 : Timing, Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis, and Efficient flop coding style** 
### Lecture + VSD-IAT recordining Topics 
* Fundamental of CMOS

complementary metal-oxide semiconductor 

used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips

the outputs of the PMOS and NMOS transistors are complementary to create an inverting output

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/Day_2/1.jpg)

* Setup and Hold time

Setup Time is the time that the input data signals need to become stable before the active clock edge occurs

Hold Time is the time that the input data signals need to become stable after the active clock edge occurs

* .Lib

Collection of standard cells

The naming of the library includes the specific process (typical/nominal/..), temperature and voltage for the design.

The libraries created are characterized to model the variations in the process, voltage and temperature (PVT)

The variations in the process, temperature and voltage of design determines how the design will operate, and the design should be able to operate across all corners 
with the regard to difference in PVT

The library specifies on needed information for the cell mapping such as the technology, delay model, units of measurements, operating conditions , etc,.

The library holds a variety of cells along specified features of the cells such as leakage power, area, signal used for pins, and features of the cell pins.

Each combination of input that produce a unique output will have a specific leakage power.

Variations of the same types of cells will also have unique features associated.

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/Day_2/2.jpg)

* Hierachical and Flat Representation

Hierarchical design shows design elements as sub-modules within “top module” rather than seeing the instantiation of gates as in flat synthesis

In a flattened “flat netlist” the hierarchies are flattened, showing all the cells used in the whole design, which is the complete structure, rather than in sub module form

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/Day_2/3.jpg)

* Sub module synthesis

we perform sub module synthesis when we have multiple instances of same module, or when the design is too complex that it would be better to divide the design into sub modules to be synthesized individually

* Stacked PMOS vs Stacked NMOS

Occasionally library elements may result in the design of a stack PMOS during synthesis

This is undesirable as stacked PMOS due to its poor mobility, therefor during synthesis the logic can be restructured to use other components to create the same logic but under a stacked NMOS

E.g. use of OR gate replaced with NAND gate and INV cells

* Gltches

Glitches are unwanted pulses at the output of combinational gates

These glitches occur due to unbalanced delay to the combinational gates

The glitch at one gate can then be feed into the following component causing the later resulting output net to be extremely glitchy and causing high dynamic power consumption.

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/Day_2/4.jpg)

* Flops

The presence of flops acts to shield the proceeding elements from being affected by the undesired glitch, as the clock signal is unaffected from data signals and glitches

The clock pin will allow the value to stay stable, and therefor avoid undesired glitches in the proceeding elements

The flops need to be initialized for the combinational circuit to have its desirable output

The flop is initialized through its control pins (Reset | Set)

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/Day_2/5.jpg)

* Asynchronous vs Synchronous

Asynchronous flops means the output of the circuit will be triggered from the rising edge of the set/reset signal, in addition to the rising edge of the clock signal

Synchronous flops means the output of the circuit will be triggered solely on the rising edge of the clock signal, a rising edge in the set/reset pin will not prompt data to be captured

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/Day_2/6.jpg)

> when set pin is low, the q pin will be equal to d pin at the rising edge of clock signal

> data at q can either change at the rising egde of clock or set signal
> if set pin is toggeled high, the q will turn high as well

## **Day_3 : Combinational and sequential optimizations** 
### Lecture + VSD-IAT recordining Topics 
* Nature of synthesis and optimization

Synthesis is not a push button solution

It is dependant on the design statement and clarity of implementation

Some areas will have been applied optimization strategies, and some wont

An area or can be flagged for high effort optimization or set to don’t touch status

The more the design is affected by tool methodologies, the more likely it is to divert from the original design intent

* Optimization methodology

The synthesis tool will perform optimization by minimizing cost functions (design rule costs and optimization costs)

Cost functions vary depending on the EDA tool vendor

Optimization of a design will be an iterative process, as the results of synthesis are dependant on multiple factors such as libraries, constraints and coding styles

Optimizations costs = max delay cost + min delay cost + max power cost + max area cost (most important to least important, may vary depending on EDA vendor)

* Boolean Algebra basics

Boolean algebra constitutes a majority of the combinational optimization

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/1.jpg)

de morgan rule is used to transfor or gate into inverting nand gate, as or gate uses stacked pmos which is undesirable

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/5.jpg)

* Combinational and Sequential Optimization

Constant propagation is the simplification of a combinational circuit through boolean minimization, allowing less components to used Constant propagation occurs for both combinational and sequential logic

Synthesis optimization also allows improvement on circuit delay, as timing constraints may not be met with original logic, thus circuit is optimized by the tool to reduce gate count and minimize delay to value within expectation 

Constant propagation in combinational logic is based on Boolean algebra, whereas for sequential constant propagation, it is dependant on Boolean algebra and timing diagram analysis

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/2.jpg)

One of the additional optimization techniques is known as resource sharing, common inputs would be eliminated, which would also increase the number of fanouts, leaving the overall logic to be distorted in comparison to the original logic intent

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/6.jpg)

Boundary optimization is another technique used, where the boundaries inside top level design are optimized, the constants are pushed into and out of hierarchy, and rewires feed throughs and complementary signals

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/7.jpg)

Register retiming can also be done by readjusting the combinational logic, allowing the overall operating frequency to be increased

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/4.jpg)

State optimization is the optimization of unused gates

Cloning is a physical aware optimization that decreases the load of heavily loaded cell by replicating the cell

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/3.jpg)

> based on logic, input and b are fed into and gate, then the output is fed with input c into and or gate within 1 cell

#### Sequential Logic Optimization

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/15.jpg)

dff_const1: 
> while reset pin is high, Q is low
> if reset toggeled to zero, q will not immediately switch to high, but only once triggered by positive edge of clock

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/16.jpg)

dff_const2: 
> while set pin is high, Q is high
> since input D is set high, if set is toggeled to low, the value remians high even as triggered by clock, as q = d

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/16.jpg)

dff_const3: 
> two flops used where the output of teh first is fed into the second
> output of first flop is similar to dff_const1
> the second flop out put stays high while set is high, once set is low, it will latch to the immdieate value of Q1, but due to delay, the value will be low, until it becomes high at the next positive edge

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/17.jpg)

dff_const4: 
> first flop behave similar to dff_const2, where output is high only
> second flop replicates this behaviour as well as its input Q1 is always high, so output q will also be always high

![](https://github.com/YishenKuma/sd_training/blob/main/day3/18.jpg)

dff_const5: 
> output of first flop is similar to dff_const1
> second flop also replicates the behaviour, but since its input is Q1, which toggels from low to high, Q must also toggle from low to high
> reason as to why both flops do not go high at the same time at the first positive clock edge after reset goes low, is because of the delayed capture of data at input, thus value is low until proceeding positive clock edge
