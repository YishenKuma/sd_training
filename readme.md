### Lecture Topics
* Chip and Package

Chip: The assembly of active and passive electronic components, along with their inetrconnections, fabricated as a single unit on a thin substrate of semiconductor material.

Package: The housing that chips are placed in. The package is then either plugged into or soldered onto the printed circuit board. 

* Wire bonding

Wire bonds are the interconnections between an integrated circuit (IC) or other semiconductor device and its packaging during semiconductor device fabrication.

* Core and IO

Core: the section of the chip where the fundamental logic of the design is placed (Macros, IPs, Etc,.)

IO: allows the communication of data between die and external components

IO Pads: acting as gateway, connecting internal signals from the core of the integrated circuit to the external pins of the chip package

* Macros and IPs
<!---

Macros: Simple custom built cell serving a sepecific funtional purpose that can be found through open sources

Foundry IPs: Macro cells developed with the intent of licencing to multiple vendor for using as building blocks in different chip designs, known as Intellectual Property 

* Communication between software and hardware

Compiler: reads the complete source program written in high-level language as a whole in one go and translates it into an equivalent program in assembly language

Assembler: translate the program written in assembly language into machine code represented by binary code
